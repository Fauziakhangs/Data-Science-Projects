# Data-Science-Project
Projects related to predictive modeling, regression models, clustering etc

HW5: This project is related to data analysis and preprocessing of a dataset on student performance. 
The code covers various aspects of data exploration, data cleaning, data preprocessing, clustering, classification, and evaluation. 
It includes tasks such as visualizing data distributions, handling imbalanced data, normalizing data, creating dummy variables for 
categorical features, and applying machine learning models (k-nearest neighbors and kknn) for prediction and classification. The code
also calculates and visualizes performance metrics such as RMSE, R-squared, MAE, and AUC. Overall, the code demonstrates a comprehensive
analysis of student performance data with the goal of building predictive models and evaluating their performance.
