# Data-Science-Project

**🔍 Data Exploration and Visualization**
This project begins with an in-depth exploration of the student performance dataset. Various visualizations are used to understand the data distribution, identify trends, and detect anomalies. Special attention is given to handling imbalanced classes to ensure balanced model training.

**🧹 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
Next, the dataset undergoes thorough cleaning and preprocessing. Techniques such as normalization and the creation of dummy variables for categorical features are applied to prepare the data for modeling. These steps ensure the data is standardized and suitable for machine learning algorithms.

**🤖 Predictive Modeling and Classification**
The project applies classification algorithms like k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and kknn to predict student outcomes. The models are trained using the processed data, with a focus on building accurate and reliable predictive models.

**📈 Model Evaluation and Metrics**
Model performance is evaluated using key metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Area Under the Curve (AUC). These metrics are visualized to provide insights into how well the models predict student performance.
